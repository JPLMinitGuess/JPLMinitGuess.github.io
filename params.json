{"name":"MinitGuess","tagline":"Automating Initial Guess Generation in Mystic","body":"### Welcome to the MinitGuess Homepage!\r\nMinitGuess is an open source software toolbox designed to allow the automation of initial guess generation for orbital mechanics problems. Containing pre-computed data and models along with sample scenarios, the software allows for orbit creation and dynamical model integration in medium fidelity for feasibility analysis and export to higher fidelity models. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n1. A Dynamical System Exploration Toolbox\r\n2. Dynamical Model Set: includes CR3BP, EH3BP, etc.\r\n3. Orbit Database: pre-computed orbits (periodic, quasi-periodic, etc.)\r\n4. Object-oriented approach for easy code reuse and maintenance\r\n5. Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command-Line Interface (CLI) available\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.github.com/JPLMinitGuess/JPLMinitGuess.github.io/master/Hebes_Chasma_landslides.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nClick the download icons at the top of the homepage or download the files at [http://github.com/JPLMinitGuess/JPLMinitGuess.github.io](http://github.com/JPLMinitGuess/JPLMinitGuess.github.io)\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n* Benjamin Villac: project management and GUI layout, tools implementation\r\n* Navid Nakhjiri: models, integration, maps, testing\r\n* Hsuan-Chen Wan (@walterwan): GUI development, quasi-periodic orbit class, models\r\n* Olivia Domenici: GUI development\r\n* Eric Arnal Fort: periodic orbit database, discrete searches\r\n* Jesse Campbell: function representation via NURBS, approximation techniques\r\n* Adam Shutts: models, website\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with MinitGuess?
